You can see above the basic structure of the boilerplate and the main differences with the official Jekyll folder structure

### Configurations
* The required configurations are all in `_config.yml`
* Also edit `package.json` the name is used in the meta tags
* If you want a `manifest.json` file please edit `config/webpack.pwa.js`
* Replace the different icon by yours in `_images` and in the root folder

### Assets
* SCSS partials should be located in `_scss` for better reading
* Put all your images in `_images` the content of this folder will be moved to the `_site/assets/images` so you can access them with this path `/assets/images/**` in your templates, check the examples
* Put all your Javascript files inside `_src` and import them from `index.js` or you can also add them as a new entry point in your webpack configuration file

### Internationalization
* All the posts should be there in inside `_i18n` folder inside its language, check the boilerplate examples
* You can put your variables inside `_i18n/en.yml` (replace en with your language) and call them in your template with `{% t variable_name.sub_variable %}`
* You can remove the plugin by removing `gem 'jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin'` from `gemfile` and `jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin` from `plugins` in `_config.yml`
* We invite you to read the very good [official documentation](https://github.com/Anthony-Gaudino/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin) of the plugin Jekyll multiple language plugin

## Build

### Optimized website
To build the website run the following line

```
npm run build

# or if you want the critical css
npm run build:optim
```
The built website will be in `_site` folder.

You can also run a local server to test it with this command
```
npm run serve:dist
```

### PWA
If you want to build a PWA (including the manifest.json and the service worker) run the following. Please ensure to have configured this file `config/webpack.pwa.js`
The built website will be in `_site` folder.
```
npm run build:pwa

# or if you want the critical css
npm run build:pwa:optim
```

### Clean assets & \_site folders
This will remove the generated folders
```
npm run clean:project
```

## Known issues
* Jekyll watch doesn't reload / rebuild when a translation file is updated inside `_i18n` folder, I recommand to remove `jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin` if you don't want a multi language website and if you want to watch / rebuild faster. Otherwise close and start  `npm run start` to rebuild and see your changes from `_i18n`
* The critical CSS Path may show some weird behavior when the page is loading that is why there are separated npm scripts
